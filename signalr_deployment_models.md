# SignalR Single Server vs Multi-Server

---

## SignalR Single Server

- **Setup:** SignalR runs on a single server instance.
- **How it works:** All clients connect to that one server.
- **Pros:**
  - Simple to set up and maintain.
  - Works well for small-scale apps or development.
- **Cons:**
  - Scalability is limited — only as powerful as one server.
  - If the server goes down, all connections drop.
  - No built-in way to share client connection state if you have multiple server instances.

## SignalR Multi-Server (Scaling Out)

- **Setup:** SignalR runs on multiple servers (a server farm or cloud instances).
- **How it works:** Clients connect to different servers, but the servers must coordinate to share messages and connection info.
- **Challenge:** SignalR uses in-memory connection state, which is local to each server. So without coordination, messages sent to one server won’t reach clients connected to another.
- **Solution:** Use a **backplane** or **distributed messaging system** to coordinate servers:
  - **Redis backplane**
  - **Azure SignalR Service** (a fully managed backplane for scaling)
  - **SQL Server backplane** (less common now)
- **Pros:**
  - Can handle a large number of clients.
  - Fault-tolerant; if one server fails, others continue.
- **Cons:**
  - More complex setup.
  - Backplane adds latency and operational overhead.

## When to Use Which?

- **Single server:** Small apps, dev/testing, or low traffic.
- **Multi-server:** Production apps with high concurrency and reliability requirements.

## Mermaid Diagrams

### Single Server
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph SingleServer["Single Server"]
        S1[Server]
        C1[Client 1]
        C2[Client 2]
        C3[Client 3]

        S1 <--> C1
        S1 <--> C2
        S1 <--> C3
    end
```

### Multi-Server with Backplane
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph MultiServer["Multi-Server with Backplane"]
        S2[Server A]
        S3[Server B]
        BP[(Backplane)]
        C4[Client 1]
        C5[Client 2]
        C6[Client 3]

        S2 <--> C4
        S3 <--> C5
        S3 <--> C6

        S2 <--> BP
        S3 <--> BP
    end
```

### Azure SignalR Service
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph AzureSignalR["Azure SignalR Service"]
        AS[(SignalR Service)]
    end

    App1[App Server A]
    App2[App Server B]

    C7[Client 1]
    C8[Client 2]
    C9[Client 3]

    App1 <--> AS
    App2 <--> AS

    AS <--> C7
    AS <--> C8
    AS <--> C9
